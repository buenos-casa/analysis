Feature Influence on Gap

We conducted an analysis on a subset of the data that included the years 2015 - 2017. We determined most-contributing continuous features for each year in all of Buenos Aires. The findings of this analysis provides insight into governmental and cultural shifts that drove buyer and seller home pricing.


In 2015, the most influential factors were the actual property value, distance to public wifi, % of people with (high school?) education, and % of people renting. In 2016, the most influential factors were the actual property value, % of people renting, % of people with mobile phones, and distance to a health facility. In 2017, the most influential factors were the actual property value, total area of the property, and cellular percent.


Considering these results, it is apparent that the actual price of each property is the most driving factor of the price gap. Therefore, we can infer that likelihood that a home actually sells for its listed price is dependent on whether buyers agrees with the proposed worth. This is  inherently true in a market enterprise, so this was an expected result.

An interesting factor that was gathered from the results is that in the earlier years, public wifi access was a primary locational feature contributing to the price gap. This provided some evidence to external factors pushing the importance of wifi access as it related to the price gap. This means that close public wifi could influence perceived property worth from both a buyer and seller perspective. The Buenos Aires government made concerted efforts to increase awareness of digital access.  Such efforts included publishing lists of more that 400 wifi spots in the city. Also, in 2016, the Argentine government launched the “Digital Country Plan” which provided free public wifi to more than 1000 municipalities across the country.

A feature that was signifiant in all years to the same degree was the % of people using a cellular device. This may be attributed to the fact that individuals with cell phones can check prices other homes in the area to influence perception of property worth from the initial listing to the actual selling time point.
